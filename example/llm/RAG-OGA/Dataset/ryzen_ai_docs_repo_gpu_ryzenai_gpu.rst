Prerequisites
*************

- DirectX12 capable Windows OS (Windows 11 recommended)
- Latest AMD `GPU device driver <https://www.amd.com/en/support>`_ installed
- `Microsoft Olive <https://microsoft.github.io/Olive/how-to/installation.html>`_ for model conversion and optimization
- Latest `ONNX Runtime DirectML EP <https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.html>`_ 

You can ensure GPU driver and DirectX version from ``Windows Task Manager`` -> ``Performance`` -> ``GPU`` 

******************************
Running models on Ryzen AI GPU
******************************

Running models on the Ryzen AI GPU is accomplished in two simple steps: 

**Model Conversion and Optimization**: After the model is trained, Microsoft Olive Optimizer can be used to convert the model to ONNX and optimize it for optimal target execution.  

For additional information, refer to the `Microsoft Olive Documentation <https://microsoft.github.io/Olive/>`_


**Deployment**: Once the model is in the ONNX format, the ONNX Runtime DirectML EP (``DmlExecutionProvider``) is used to run the model on the AMD Ryzen AI GPU. 

For additional information, refer to the `ONNX Runtime documentation for the DirectML Execution Provider <https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/execution-providers/DirectML-ExecutionProvider.html>`_

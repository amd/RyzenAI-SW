Quantization Symmetry
=====================

``Symmetric/Asymmetric Quantization`` is primarily used to describe the quantization of integers. ``Symmetric Quantization`` involves scaling the data by a fixed scaling factor, and the zero-point is generally set at zero. ``Asymmetric Quantization`` uses a scaling factor and a zero-point that can shift, allowing the zero of the quantized data to represent a value other than zero.

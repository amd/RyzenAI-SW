Quantization Symmetry
=====================

``Symmetric/Asymmetric quantization`` is primarily used to describe the
quantization of integers. ``Symmetric quantization`` involves scaling
the data by a fixed scaling factor, and zero-point is generally set at
zero. ``Asymmetric quantization`` uses a scaling factor and a zero-point
that can shift, allowing the zero of the quantized data to represent a
value other than zero.

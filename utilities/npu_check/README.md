# NPU Check Utilities

A set of APIs to extract information about the NPU and check compatibility of the VitisAI EP with the rest of the environment.

```
namespace npu_util {

    enum Status {
        OK = 0,
        UNKNOWN,
        NPU_UNRECOGNIZED,
        DRIVER_TOO_OLD,
        EP_TOO_OLD
    };

    struct NPUInfo {
        int device_id;
        std::string device_name;
        DWORDLONG driver_version_number;
        std::string driver_version_string;
        Status check;
    };

    // Return a vector of DXGI adapter descriptions to see which GPUs can be used
    std::vector<DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC> enumerateDXGIAdapters();

    // Checks whether the system configuration is compatible for VitisAI EP 1.2
    NPUInfo checkCompatibility_RAI_1_2();

    // Checks whether the system configuration is compatible for VitisAI EP 1.3
    NPUInfo checkCompatibility_RAI_1_3();

    // Checks whether the system configuration is compatible for VitisAI EP 1.3.1
    NPUInfo checkCompatibility_RAI_1_3_1();

    // Checks whether the system configuration is compatible for VitisAI EP 1.4
    NPUInfo checkCompatibility_RAI_1_4();

    // Checks whether the system configuration is compatible for VitisAI EP 1.4.1
    NPUInfo checkCompatibility_RAI_1_4_1();

}
```

The APIs implement compatibility checks for specific versions of the VitisAI EP. These APIs return a `NPUInfo` struct containing various information about the environment.

The `check` field of the `NPUInfo` struct is set to `Status::OK` if the following conditions are met:
 - The system has a supported AMD NPU
 - NPU drivers are installed, and the version satisfies the minimum version required by the VitisAI EP being used.
 - The current date is less than 3 years after the release of the VitisAI EP being used.

If the `check` field is set to a value other than `Status::OK`, the application should not use the VitisAI EP.

The `device_id` field contains the NPU device ID. This value should be used by the application to determine whether to load a PHX or STX xclbin.
 - 0x1502 -> PHX/HPT
 - 0x17F0 -> STX/KRK

The `npu_util.cpp` file must be compiled with the `/std:c++latest` option.

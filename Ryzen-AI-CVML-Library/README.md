<a name="top"></a>
The Ryzen AI Libraries build on top of the Ryzen AI drivers and execution
infrastructure to provide powerful AI capabilities to C++ applications without
having to worry about training specific AI models and integrating them to the
Ryzen AI framework.

Each Ryzen AI CVML library feature offers a simple C++ application programming
interface (API) that can be easily incorporated into existing applications.

Executing Ryzen AI CVML library enabled applications
====================================================

The Ryzen AI CVML library selects the appropriate hardware (e.g., GPU or NPU) and framework for performing inference operations by default. An API is also available to set the preferred inference backend for those applications that wish to do so.

In order to execute applications that utilize the Ryzen AI CVML library, the appropriate drivers must first be installed on the target system, and the Ryzen AI CVML library files must be included with the application itself.

> Ryzen AI CVML library features that utilize the ONNX backend for NPU operations may experience a longer startup latency the first time they are executed on a device. This increased startup latency does not occur for subsequent runs the feature.

Locating Ryzen AI CVML library runtime files for [Windows](#windows_execution) and [Linux](#linux_execution)
--------------------------------------------

When executing applications built against the Ryzen AI CVML library, ensure that:

<a name="windows_execution"></a>
For Windows, either one of the following conditions are met:
1. The Ryzen AI CVML library runtime dll and graphlib files are in the same folder
   as the application executable.
2. The Ryzen AI CVML library's **windows/** folder has been added to the PATH
   environment variable.

<a name="linux_execution"></a>
For Linux, all the following conditions are met.
1. Add location of **linux/** to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
2. Add location of NPU driver libs (/opt/xilinx/xrt/lib) to LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Programming guide for C++ Applications
======================================

Incorporating the Ryzen AI's optimized features into C++ applications can be
done in a few simple steps, as explained in the following sections.

[Back to top](#top)

Include Ryzen AI CVML library headers
-------------------------------------

The required definitions for compiling each Ryzen AI feature are included in a
corresponding,

    cvml-feature-name.h

header file under the **include/** folder, where `feature-name` is the name
of the desired Ryzen AI feature.

For example, the definitions for the Ryzen AI Depth Estimation feature are
available after adding a line similar to the following example:

    #include <cvml-depth-estimation.h>

Details about each feature's programming interface and expected usage are
provided within their individual include headers.

[Back to top](#top)

Create Ryzen AI CVML library context
------------------------------------

Each Ryzen AI CVML library feature is created against a *CVML context* (see amd::cvml::Context).
The context provides access to common functions for logging, etc. A pointer to a new
context may be obtained by calling the `amd::cvml::CreateContext()` function:

    auto ryzenai_context = amd::cvml::CreateContext();

When no longer needed, the context may be released using its `Release()`
member function:

    ryzenai_context->Release();

[Back to top](#top)

Create Ryzen AI CVML library feature object
-------------------------------------------

The application programming interface for each feature is provided via a
*Ryzen AI CVML library C++ feature object* that may be instantiated once a
Ryzen AI CVML library context has been created.

The following example instantiates a feature object for the depth estimation
library:

    amd::cvml::DepthEstimation ryzenai_depth_estimation(ryzenai_context);

[Back to top](#top)

Encapsulate image buffers
-------------------------

The Ryzen AI CVML library defines its own *Image* class (see amd::cvml::Image) for
representing images and video frame buffers. Each *Image* object is assigned a
specific format and data type on creation. For example, an *Image* to encapsulate
an incoming RGB888 frame buffer can be created with the following code:

    amd::cvml::Image ryzenai_image(amd::cvml::Image::Format::kRGB,
                                   amd::cvml::Image::DataType::kUint8, width,
                                   height, data_pointer);

[Back to top](#top)

Execute the feature
-------------------

To execute a Ryzen AI feature on a provided input, call the appropriate
*execution* member function of the Ryzen AI CVML library feature object.

For example, the following code executes a single instance of the depth
estimation library, using the *ryzenai_image* from the previous section:

    // encapsulate output buffer
    amd::cvml::Image ryzenai_output(amd::cvml::Image::Format::kGrayScale,
                                    amd::cvml::Image::DataType::kFloat32,
                                    output_width, output_height, output_pointer);

    // execute the feature
    ryzenai_depth_estimation.GenerateDepthMap(ryzenai_image, &ryzenai_output);

Building applications with Ryzen AI CVML Libraries
==================================================

When building applications against the Ryzen AI CVML library, ensure that the
library's,

    include/

folder is part of the compiler's include paths, and that the library's,

    windows/ or linux/

folder has been added to the linker's library paths.

Depending on the application's build environment, it may also be necessary to
explicitly list which of the Ryzen AI CVML library's .LIB files (when building for
Windows applications) need to be linked.

[Back to top](#top)

Building Ryzen AI CVML library applications with CMake
------------------------------------------------------

If CMake is used for the application's build environment, the necessary
include folder and link libraries can be added with the following lines
in the application's CMakeLists.txt file:

    # find Ryzen AI CVML library and set include folders
    find_package(RyzenAILibrary REQUIRED PATHS ${AMD_CVML_SDK_ROOT})

    # add Ryzen AI CVML library linker libraries
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} ${RyzenAILibrary_LIBS})

where `AMD_CVML_SDK_ROOT` defines the location of the Ryzen AI CVML library files and
`PROJECT_NAME` defines the name of the application build target.

[Back to top](#top)

Building Ryzen AI CVML library sample applications
--------------------------------------------------

In addition to general Ryzen AI CVML library prerequisite and dependencies listed
under [Prerequisites and dependencies](#dependencies), the included sample
applications also make use of OpenCV for reading input images/videos/camera
and displaying final output windows. A copy of [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
will need to be downloaded to the development system before the samples can
be rebuilt and/or executed.

Ensure the following prerequisites have been set up to build Ryzen AI CVML library sample applications:
- CMake has been installed and is available in the system/user path
- On Windows, Visual Studio's "Desktop development with C++" build tools, or a comparable C++ toolchain, has been installed
- The location of OpenCV libraries has been assigned to the `OPENCV_INSTALL_ROOT` environment variable
- The relative locations of the `include`, `windows`, `linux`, and `samples` folders are unchanged

The following are CMake commands for building samples.

On Windows:
```
cd samples/
mkdir build
cmake -S %CD% -B %CD%\build -DOPENCV_INSTALL_ROOT=$OPENCV_INSTALL_ROOT$
cmake --build %CD%\build --config Release
```

On Linux:
```
cd samples/
mkdir build
cmake -S $PWD -B $PWD/build -DOPENCV_INSTALL_ROOT=$OPENCV_INSTALL_ROOT
cmake --build $PWD/build --config Release
```

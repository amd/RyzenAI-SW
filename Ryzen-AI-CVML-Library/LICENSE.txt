        employees and contractors' adherence to the terms of this Agreement.
        You may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with an

        either (a) give AMD prompt written notice prior to such disclosure
        (except where prohibited by applicable law) to allow AMD a reasonable
        opportunity to seek a protective order or equivalent or (b) obtain
        written assurance from the applicable judicial or governmental entity
        that it will afford the Confidential Information the highest level of
        protection afforded under applicable law or regulation, in which case
        You agree to disclose only that portion of Confidential Information
        required by such applicable judicial or governmental entity.

        upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party.  This
        Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from AMD or
        judicial resolution upon Your breach or Your sublicensee's breach of
        the terms of this Agreement.  The termination of this Agreement shall:
        (i)  immediately result in the termination of all rights granted by You

             under Section 2; and
        (ii) have no effect on any sublicenses previously granted by You to end
             users under Subsection 2.1 which are compliant with all terms and
             conditions of this Agreement, and  such sublicenses shall survive
             in accordance with their terms. Upon termination or expiration of
             this Agreement, all provisions survive except for Section 2, and

        technical data or software to any country for which the United States
        or any other applicable government requires an export license or other
        governmental approval without first obtaining such licenses or
        approvals; or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations of the
        United States or the country where the technical data or software was
        obtained.  You acknowledge the technical data and software received
